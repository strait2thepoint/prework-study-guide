 # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I wanted to make this website to investigate the various langauges of coding.  This project encapsulated everything I was looking to learn, HTML, CSS, & Javascript.
-This website helps students of MSU coding bootcamp to study as they progress along in the program.
- While doing this project, I learned that my love of problem solving and agile thinking lends itself well to coding.  I also learned that by using coding langauges, I felt so much closer to the women of the past who were some of the first coders.  I noticed that coding is a lot like music, recipes, and knitting or crocheting patterns.  Several of the basic building blocks of coding call to the roots of what some would consider the domestic arts.  I love that the fingerprints of these historic women can still be seen years later.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section contains a few lines of information about the topic listed in the header.  The HTML section contains important notes about HTML and so forth.  We have inserted an image in the HTML section and have also included a prompt to look at the DevTools console in the web browser.  By doing so, we can see Javascript functioning by looking at the console.  The Javascript portion has a randomizer built into it so that it prompts the user to study the listed topics at random.  

## Credits

I would like to especially thank codebubb on Youtube, as I needed to debug things a few times and found some of his videos especially helpful.  Particularly his command line tutorials and Javascript tutorials were helpful.
